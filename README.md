# sudoku-solver
Even though it's probably been done thousands of times, I made a sudoku solver in C++.

##To run (UNIX systems)
###Clone this repo
`git clone https://github.com/tylerjdurden/sudoku-solver`
###Change directories
`cd sudoku-solver/`
###Build the project
`make`
###Run the project
`make run`
From here, I'd recommend just reading in from standard keyboard input. Although, some puzzles are available to read from file in the `puzzles/` directory!
